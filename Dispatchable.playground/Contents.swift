 # Dispatchable
 A simple library to help test asynchronous code.
 - All code is run on the main thread when running tests.
 - Records asynchronous behaviour which can be checked in your tests.
 ## Testing Asynchronous Code
 Ideally asynchronous tests should be avoided to ensure unit tests are quick and robust. 
 - note:Â *What asynchronous code should you verify?*
 It's probably not essential to verify what exactly runs on a separate thread but it is often essential to test the behaviour of threading in your application. For example, whether completion blocks are fired on the main thread.

 ## How to access `MockDispatchable`
 There are 2 ways to set up `Dispatchable` for testing.
 ### `@testable import Dispatchable` in your tests.
 `MockDispatchable` is an `internal` `class` and cannot be accessed by your production code. However, in you tests you can `@testable import Dispatchable` to give you access to the mock.  
 - important: This will only work if you build `Dispatchable` using the `Debug` configuration. If this doesn't suit you then follow the method below.
 - note: The mock will not be included when building using the release configuration to ensure it can never be included in production code.
 ### Copy the MockDispatchable.swift file into your test target.
 This is not preferred because the mock will become out of sync with the framework as it changes.
